I am a PhD candidate at the Urban Analytics Lab, National University of Singapore. My research interests lie at the intersection of urban morphology, spatial perception, and deep learning, with a special focus on Street View Imagery (SVI), its usability and uncertainty as a research tool. I am currently engaged in investigating and simulating the complexity of human visual perception in 3D built environments.
