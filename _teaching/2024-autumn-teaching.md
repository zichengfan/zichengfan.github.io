This module introduces you to applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially with respect to the design of our environment. Application spaces may include buildings, public spaces, landscapes, dwellings, transportation nodes, and recreational areas. AI can support the designer in the design decision making process, through both analysis and synthesis. In this module you will be presented with an overview of different kinds of AI applications for design, with a partial focus on the application of an AI-based methodology for design exploration with respect to selected performance indicators, and another on the application of image-based AI techniques supporting design space interpretation.
